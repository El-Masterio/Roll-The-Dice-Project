# Roll-The-Dice #2 Project

the way to play is you press Roll the dice and keep rolling the numbers, each time you role the number roled is added to the total sum of numbers.. now you can press hold to keep that number you gathered and when you press hold the control goes to the second player or you can risk it and try to get a higher number but if the roled number is 0 you will get nothing and the other player starts rolling.


the roles is the first one that gets to the total sum of 100 that is holded of course, he wins the game!
